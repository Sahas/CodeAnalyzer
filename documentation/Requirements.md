## Functional
1. Input = Single source File of a language
2. Output =
    1. Number of blank lines
    2. Number of lines with Comments
    3. Number of lines with code
    4. Total number of lines in file
3. Support one programming language syntax  - [Done]
4. Types of lines you should support: Blank, Comments, Code - [Done]
5. A line counts as a comment only if it has no other code. - [Done]
6. Design for extensibility: you should be able to support new language syntaxes by extending your solution.  - [Done]
7. One passing test  - []

Not necessary to have running code for the following requirements, but account for these in your design.
1. Supporting multiple syntaxes - []
2. Supporting multiple files and giving totals for an entire source tree. Supporting multi-line comments - [Done]
3. Ability to add more granular breakup (eg: classify lines as imports, variable declarations, etc) - [Done]


## Non-Functional
1. Readable  & Intuitive Code
